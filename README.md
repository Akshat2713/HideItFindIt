# HideItFindIt

## About the Project 🛠️
**HideItFindIt** is an Android application designed to securely hide and manage images, videos, notes, and folders. It allows users to hide content from public visibility (e.g., gallery apps) and safely store them in hidden directories within the app's private storage. The app also provides features for unhiding content and restoring them to their original locations.

## Features ✨
- **Image Management**: Hide images from the gallery and organize them into folders.
- **Unhide Images**: Restore hidden images back to their original locations, making them visible again.
- **Folder Management**: Create and manage folders for images and videos.
- **Media Handling**: Safely store and manage videos in hidden directories.
- **Notes Management**: Add, edit, and delete text notes for secure storage.
